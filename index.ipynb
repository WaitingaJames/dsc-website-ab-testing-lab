In both cases, the p-value is less than the significance level of 0.05, which suggests that the difference in click-through rates between the two groups is statistically significant. The difference in proportions calculated using the binomial test also confirms that the experimental homepage is more effective than the control homepage, as the difference is positive and the confidence interval does not include 0."
